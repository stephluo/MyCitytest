1. When you say you want to digitize their application for a dog license, what are exact models and requirments beyond having some form fields to be included and uploaded to a database: 
Is there an email confirmation to both the administrator and the citizen?
Will the user be able to have an account where they can log in to check status, renew, make payments?
What reporting is needed for admin users?
What is the payment gateway?
How many users do you expect the application to handle? 
How many years of archive data shall the system maintain?  

2. What are fields of data will you be needing to collect? Are their any digital images or documents that will also go along with that?
3. Will the identification number of the dog tag be manually generated or would you prefer that I generate it on the fly, include that in the database, and then link up with a dog tag manufacturer api on your behalf?
4. If we are going to be building this on your website, I will utilize the same or similiar stylings so that it does look cohesive? If you have another location that you would like for this application, let me know.
5. Will you require me to tie into an existing database adding Dog Tag Applications to a specific database. In the case of using Wordpress, I would ask whether they wanted the data in the WP database or external one. 
6. Do you want a mobile responsive site or both a destop site and mobile app?
